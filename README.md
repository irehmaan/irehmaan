**About Me**

I'm passionate about exploring the potential of the **Internet of Things (IoT)** and leveraging its capabilities to create innovative solutions. I have hands-on experience working with various microcontrollers, including **ESP32, NodeMCU, and Arduino**, to build IoT projects that bridge the physical and digital worlds.

In addition to IoT,** ** I'm also an intermediate app developer using Flutter****. Flutter is a powerful framework for building cross-platform mobile applications, and I enjoy utilizing its capabilities to create intuitive and visually appealing apps.

**Projects**

Here are some of the projects you'll find in my GitHub repositories:

**1. IoT Projects**

Smart Home Automation: A project that demonstrates the automation of home appliances using IoT technologies. It utilizes NodeMCU boards to control devices remotely through a mobile app such as Blynk IoT.

Weather Monitoring System: An IoT-based basic weather monitoring system built with ESP32. It collects weather data from sensors(DHT11 & BMP 180). The sensor data is uploaded to Firebase thorugh which  it displays it on a mobile app developed with help of Flutter.

**2. Flutter Apps**

NewsApp: A Flutter app that fetches news articles using the NewsAPI and displays them in a user-friendly format. Users can browse different categories, search for specific topics, and read full articles within the app.

Amazon Music Clone: Currently, I'm working on an exciting project—a clone of the Amazon Music app. It aims to replicate the core features of the original app, including music streaming, playlists, recommendations, and user profiles.

**3. Microcontroller Projects**

Home Automation with Arduino: An Arduino-based home automation system that enables users to control lights, fans, and other appliances through a mobile app or voice commands.

Security System with ESP32: A security system built using ESP32 that detects motion and sends alerts to the user's smartphone. It incorporates features like live streaming, image capture, and push notifications.

**Contributions and Collaborations**

I'm always open to collaborations and contributions. If you find any of my projects interesting or have ideas for improvements, feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or reach out to me for collaboration opportunities.
